OPTIMIZATIONS

The mongodb record structure should store jersey number as separate attribute and not a part of Name attribute.
e.g

{
    "_id": {
        "$oid": "4e9f1d2ae4b0ea13e65510f4"
    },
    "name": "mark sanchez,
	"jersey_no":"6",
    "team": "jets",
    "position": "qb"
}

This will reduce string operations.

We can directly get value by 

Players.findone(query).sort("jersey_no",1);
